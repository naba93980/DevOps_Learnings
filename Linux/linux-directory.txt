1. / (Root): Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy. 
   The only root user has the right to write under this directory.

2. /bin : Essential command binary executables that need to be available in single-user mode; for all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp.
   Binaries needed for normal/standard system functioning at any run level.

3. /boot : Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd - all booting related information.

4. /dev : Essential device files, all hardware devices attached to machine.

5. /etc : Host-specific system-wide configuration files for all programs.

6. /home : Users’ home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.

7. init is parent of all Linux processes with PID or process ID of 1. It is the first process to start 
   when a computer boots up and runs until the system shuts down. init stands for initialization.

8. /lib : Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin/ and /sbin/.

9. /lost+found : The lost+found directory is a construct used by the fsck system utility. 
   It's a special directory that contains data that has become obsolete. 
	
10. /media : Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs. 

11. /mnt : Temporarily mounted filesystems.

12. /opt : Optional application software packages.

13. /proc : Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files.

14. /root : It is the root user’s home directory, which is not the same as /
 
15. /run : Modern Linux distributions include a /run directory as a temporary 
    filesystem (tmpfs) which stores volatile runtime data.

16. /sbin : Essential system binaries, e.g. fsck, init, route. The linux commands located under this 
    directory are used typically by system administrator, for system maintenance purpose.
    Binaries needed for booting, low-level system repair, or maintenance

17. /snap : Snap includes everything required to run an application, including its dependencies, in a single package.

18. /srv : Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, 
    data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems.

19. /tmp : Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users. Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.

20. /sys : It is an interface to the kernel. Specifically, it provides a filesystem-like 
    view of information and configuration settings that the kernel provides, much like /proc.

21. /usr : Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications.
    Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs.

	/usr/bin contains binary files for user programs 
	/usr/sbin contains binary files for system administrators
	/usr/lib contains libraries for /usr/bin and /usr/sbin

22. /var : Contains variable data files. This includes spool directories and files, 
    administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files.
