/etc/bash.bashrc - When bash initializes a non-login interactive bash shell on a Debian/Ubuntu-like system, the shell first reads /etc/bash.bashrc and then reads ~/.bashrc.
/home/nabajyotimodak/.bashrc - defines the shell environment for a specific user. (preferable to add PATH here, as both logged-in and non-logged-in users can use that path)

/etc/profile - is a system-wide login profile script. It also runs once when you login, but runs for all users before their user-specific .profile
/home/nabajyotimodak/.profile - is a per-user login profile. It runs once when you login and does things that a user needs when they interact with the system, such as the message of the day or a list of new messages.
